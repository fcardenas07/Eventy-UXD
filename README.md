## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 The Problem

People interested in cultural, recreational, or academic activities often miss events that match their interests because information is scattered across multiple sources, social media, outdated websites, or informal channels.  
Meanwhile, local organizers struggle to promote their activities effectively due to limited marketing resources and the lack of accessible digital tools.

**Pain points include**:

- Overpaying for events that don't meet expectations
- Poor promotion and visibility of local events
- Lack of real-time updates or notifications
- Limited social interaction with attendees

### 1.2 Our Solution

Eventy was created to bridge that gap, connecting people with the experiences around them while giving visibility to local organizers.  
The app brings together event information into one simple, location-based, and personalized platform that helps users easily discover, share, and attend activities that matter to them.

Key features:

- Interactive map showing nearby events
- Personalized feed of events
- Integrated calendar and reminders
- Social sharing and attendee interaction
- Organizer tools for event creation and promotion
- Ticketing and registration for free or paid events
- Accessibility features (high contrast, adjustable text, mobility-friendly filters)

### 6.1 Low-Fidelity Wireframes

The low-fidelity wireframes represent the initial visual structure of Eventy, focusing on layout, information hierarchy, and core user flows.  
They are used to validate usability and navigation before moving on to high-fidelity design stages, allowing quick iteration and feedback from early testing.

Key screens include:

- Home / Event Feed
- Map View & List View
- Event Detail Pages
- Organizer Panel
- Calendar & Notifications

These early prototypes help ensure intuitive navigation and clear information flow before advancing to the final design phase.
